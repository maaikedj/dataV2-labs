My name is Maaike de Jong, I'm from Amsterdam. 
I work for the Dutch Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) as a researcher and project leader in Open Science and Open Data. I have a background in research. in evolutionary ecology/ genetics/ climate change biology. As a researcher I have a lot of experience in data analysis. Also in my current job I work a lot with the technical side of research data infrastructure. 

# Why am I here

* I want to improve my Python skills for data analysis! And learn more about data visualisation and machine learning. I'm looking forward to implement my newly learned skills during the practical projects in the course. 

# What will I do after the bootcamp?

* Probably still academia/ non-profit organisations/ the Knowledge industry / perhaps commercial companies but only if they contribute to a more sustainable world
* Not sure yet what my ideal role will look like, perhaps I can use my skills in a more coordinating role.
